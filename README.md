# Project 1: Weather Intelligence Pipeline — Can We Trust This Data?

## Overview

Over the next two weeks you will build a complete, end-to-end **weather intelligence pipeline**. You will ingest historical and real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API, store it in a local DuckDB analytical database, perform rigorous statistical analysis, and build a predictive model — all while critically evaluating whether the data can be trusted.

**Why weather?** Weather data is publicly available, refreshed daily, has genuine quality challenges (sensor gaps, interpolation artefacts, seasonal non-stationarity), and is the backbone of decisions in energy, agriculture, logistics, and insurance. It is the perfect playground for asking *"Can we trust this data?"*

## Project Requirements

| Week | Focus | Skills Applied |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Week 1** (Days 1–5) | Data Engineering | Unit 2 — data sources, databases, ETL, pipelines |
| **Week 2** (Days 6–8 + Presentation) | Statistical Analysis & Prediction | Units 3 & 4.1 — descriptive stats, hypothesis testing, correlation, regression & classification modeling |

**You must:**

1. Choose **3 or more cities** (at least one should be Baku or another city relevant to you).
2. Ingest **at least 5 years** of daily historical weather data per city.
3. Ingest **real-time forecast data** (7-day forecast) for the same cities.
4. Store all data in a local **DuckDB** database with a well-designed schema.
5. Conduct **exploratory data analysis** with descriptive statistics and visualisations.
6. Formulate and execute **at least one formal hypothesis test** (more are encouraged if time permits).
7. Build **at least one statistical prediction model** (e.g., predict next-day temperature, rain probability, or seasonal anomaly) with confidence intervals.
8. Present findings on presentation day with a live pipeline demo.

## Timeline

Each day has a brief in the [`daily-briefs/`](daily-briefs/) folder with detailed tasks, deliverables, and resources. Submit a Pull Request at the end of each day showing your incremental progress.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork this repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/m5-project-weather-pipeline.git
cd m5-project-weather-pipeline
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify the API

No API key needed. Test with:

```bash
curl "https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive?latitude=40.41&longitude=49.87&start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-01-07&daily=temperature_2m_max"
```

### 4. Start Day 1

Open [`daily-briefs/day-01-project-kickoff.md`](daily-briefs/day-01-project-kickoff.md) and follow the tasks.

## Open-Meteo API Reference

[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) is a free, open-source weather API. **No API key required.**

**Historical weather endpoint:**

```
https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive?latitude=40.41&longitude=49.87&start_date=2020-01-01&end_date=2024-12-31&daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min,precipitation_sum,windspeed_10m_max
```

**Forecast endpoint:**

```
https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=40.41&longitude=49.87&daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min,precipitation_sum,windspeed_10m_max
```

Key daily variables: `temperature_2m_max`, `temperature_2m_min`, `temperature_2m_mean`, `precipitation_sum`, `rain_sum`, `snowfall_sum`, `windspeed_10m_max`, `relative_humidity_2m_mean`, `apparent_temperature_max`, `weathercode`.
